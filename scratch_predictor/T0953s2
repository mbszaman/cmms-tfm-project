ABTMpro Prediction:
Non Transmembrane protein

Predicted Probabilities:
Non Transmembrane protein 0.859613
Alpha Helical Transmembrane protein 0.03268
Beta Barrel Transembrane protein 0.107707

Predicted Contact Number:
---------------+-----------++++++++-+++++--+--+--++++++++-+-+-+++------+-+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++--+-+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++-++++++++++++++++++++++++-----

Predicted Domains:
Domain 1: 1 - 249

Predicted Disulfide Bonds:
Classification Results using Support Vector Machine:
Classification: The sequence DOES NOT HAVE disulfide bonds.
Note: If classification results are incorrect, you can still use the following prediction for the locations of disulfide bonds

Total number of cysteines: 2
Predicted number of bonds: 1

Cysteines at the following positions are predicted to form the disulfide bond:
132,150

Predicted disulfide bonds(cysteine pairs) ordered by probability in descending order:
Bond_Index	Cys1_Position	Cys2_Position
1		132		150


If you requested a SVM contact map or tertiary structure prediction, it will arrive in a separate email
